The Installation Process is Manual # Unlike Ubuntu or Fedora, which have polished graphical installers that get you up and running in 15 minutes, Arch traditionally requires you to install the system via the command line. You must manually partition drives, mount filesystems, and edit config files. While an installer script (archinstall) now exists, the system is still designed to be built by hand, which is intimidating for many.\n2. High Maintenance Overhead # Arch is a rolling release distribution. This means updates are released constantly—sometimes daily. You cannot simply \u0026ldquo;set it and forget it.\u0026rdquo; If you don\u0026rsquo;t update for a few months, you risk breaking your system when you finally do because of major library changes or keyring issues. You are expected to be the system administrator at all times.\n3. \u0026ldquo;Bleeding Edge\u0026rdquo; Can Mean \u0026ldquo;Broken\u0026rdquo; # Arch packages are very new. While this means you get the latest features immediately, it also means you are often the first to encounter bugs. Regressions (updates that break previously working features) are more common in Arch than in stable point-release distributions like Debian or Linux Mint.\n4. You Have to Configure Everything # Arch adheres to the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, which in this context means the system comes with defaults only. It does not come with a desktop environment, audio server, printer drivers, or even a web browser pre-installed. You have to choose, install, and configure every single component yourself. This leads to decision fatigue and requires time.\n5. The \u0026ldquo;RTFM\u0026rdquo; Community Culture # The Arch community is incredibly knowledgeable, but it can be abrasive to newcomers. The prevalent attitude is \u0026ldquo;Read The F***ing Manual\u0026rdquo; (RTFM). If you ask a question on the forums that is covered in the documentation, you may receive a curt response telling you to read the Wiki rather than getting a direct answer.\n6. Stability is Not Guaranteed for Servers # Because of its rapid update cycle, Arch is rarely used in enterprise server environments. In those settings, stability and predictability (knowing software versions won\u0026rsquo;t change for years) are paramount. Arch prioritizes newness over long-term unchanging stability.\n7. The Risks of the AUR (Arch User Repository) # One of Arch\u0026rsquo;s biggest draws is the AUR, a community-driven repository of packages. However, these packages are user-submitted and unmoderated. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to read and vet a PKGBUILD file (the script that builds the package), you run the risk of installing broken or, in rare cases, malicious software.\n8. No Corporate Backing # Distributions like Fedora (Red Hat), Ubuntu (Canonical), and openSUSE (SUSE) have massive corporate backing. This ensures professional quality assurance, legal accountability, and long-term support. Arch is a community project; if the maintainers decide to drop support for something or change direction, there is no corporate entity to complain to.\n9. Documentation Dependency # To run Arch successfully, you generally need to keep the Arch Wiki open. While it is widely considered the best documentation in the Linux world, having to read technical manuals just to get your Bluetooth headphones working or to set up a printer is not a user experience everyone enjoys.\n10. It Is a Time Sink # Ultimately, Arch is a hobbyist OS. If your goal is to sit down at your computer and immediately start working, coding, or gaming without thinking about the OS, Arch gets in the way. You will spend hours \u0026ldquo;tinkering\u0026rdquo; to get things perfect—time that could be spent actually using the computer.\n","date":"10 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/whyarchsucks/","section":"Posts","summary":"10 unique reasons","title":"Why Arch Sucks","type":"posts"},{"content":" Leonardo Neves # Percurso Académico # Engenharia Informática e Computadores # Instituto Superior Técnico | Set. 2023 - Presente\nConcorri para este curso como 1ª opção, movido pelo forte interesse na área da computação.

If it\u0026rsquo;s not in the config, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. This post documents my journey of moving this website from a standard Ubuntu stack to a fully reproducible NixOS VPS.\nThe entire configuration can be found in my github Deployment ✈ # Provisioning the VPS # To deploy the configuration to my remote VPS, I use nixos-rebuild with a remote target. This allows me to keep my configuration files locally, version-controlled in Git, and push changes securely over SSH.\nThe command I use to deploy changes is:\nnixos-rebuild switch --flake .#my-vps --target-host my-user@vps-ip --use-remote-sudo In case you are doing the initial installation, ensure your SSH keys are correctly added to the configuration.nix file, or you will be locked out immediately after the first reboot! Rollback Strategy # One of the \u0026ldquo;superpowers\u0026rdquo; of NixOS is the ability to undo a broken deployment instantly. If a website update fails or a service doesn\u0026rsquo;t start, I simply run:\nnixos-rebuild switch --rollback NixOS creates a new generation for every change, making rollbacks atomic and instant. How to use ❔ # Because the system is declarative, adding a new service (like a database or a reverse proxy) doesn\u0026rsquo;t require manual installation via apt or yum. You simply add the module to your configuration.nix.\nEdit your configuration file locally. Define the service (e.g., services.nginx.enable = true;). Run the rebuild command targeting the remote host. Warning: Manually editing files in /etc/ is a thing of the past. Any changes made outside of the Nix configuration will be wiped on the next rebuild. Development 🛠 # The following sections break down how I structured the Nix expression for this website.\nThe Web Server Module # I use Nginx combined with ACME (Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt) for automated SSL certificates. Here is the snippet from my webserver.nix module:\nservices.nginx = { enable = true; virtualHosts.\u0026#34;mysite.com\u0026#34; = { forceSSL = true; enableACME = true; root = \u0026#34;/var/www/my-website/public\u0026#34;; }; }; security.acme = { acceptTerms = true; defaults.email = \u0026#34;admin@mysite.com\u0026#34;; }; Nginx is enabled as a systemd service. The virtualHost block handles the domain configuration. forceSSL automatically redirects HTTP to HTTPS. enableACME handles certificate generation and renewal automatically. Flakes Integration # To ensure reproducibility across my local machine and the VPS, I opted for Nix Flakes. This locks the versions of Nixpkgs so that the environment is identical regardless of when or where it is built.\nHere is a simplified flake.nix:\n{ description = \u0026#34;My Website Infrastructure Flake\u0026#34;; inputs = { nixpkgs.url = \u0026#34;github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-24.11\u0026#34;; }; outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: { nixosConfigurations.my-vps = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem { system = \u0026#34;x86_64-linux\u0026#34;; modules = [ ./configuration.nix ]; }; }; } Inputs define the exact commit of nixpkgs to use. Outputs define the resulting system configuration. This ensures that nixos-rebuild always uses the exact same package versions. Automated Backups # Finally, I\u0026rsquo;ve integrated Restic for encrypted, off-site backups, configured entirely through Nix.\nThe backup runs every night at 3 AM. It targets specific folders defined in the config. It automatically prunes old snapshots to save space.
