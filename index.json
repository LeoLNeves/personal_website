Whats the Goal? # As my first official post, I will write about what I believe is the ultimate way to achieve total anonymity on the web. To be clear, my intention is not to create an environment where we simply browse the web anonymously. The goal is to create another identity that can normally browse the web without barriers, but that cannot be linked back to you.\nTo achieve this, there are many methods, but the one I propose has no flaws from a privacy perspective (at most, it will be slow and painful). It takes into account a global adversary with access to worldwide network traffic and advanced AI for traffic recognition. Let’s start.\n2. Use TailsOS # Even though what I’m about to describe is already extremely secure, the goal here is to prepare for the most ridiculous and worst-case scenarios. For the entire setup and future remote control of the VPS, I recommend using Tails OS from different geographical locations with public Wi-Fi (libraries, coffee shops, etc.).\nThe only situation where I see this being strictly necessary is if your VPN provider specifically targets your account—even though they would have no way of knowing you are connected to a VPS. I’m going to explain this in detail ahead.\n3. Setup a Monero Wallet # Before I reveal the plan, we need a way to anonymously pay for services. Monero (XMR) is arguably the best digital currency on the planet. It is the gold standard for anonymity because its transactions are impossible to trace, offering the same privacy that physical cash does.\nThe plan begins by creating an account. I won\u0026rsquo;t go into every detail here, but you must buy your Monero on an offshore platform or a P2P market (like Haveno). While there are multiple ways to store crypto, the single most effective method is creating your own cold wallet. You could use a Raspberry Pi and open-source software to store your keys and validate transactions offline. I also recommend having more than one Monero wallet since we are going to purchase different services that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be linked.\n4. Setup Mullvad Vpn # Out of all current VPNs, Mullvad is widely recognized as the best for privacy. It requires no authentication or identity proof; you are just a random account number. You can pay with Monero, and the setup is instant.\nWhile we can never be 100% sure of any provider, Mullvad has a proven track record. When their offices were raided in the past, the authorities found they actually had no data to expose. We use a VPN before the Tor network so your local ISP has no way to know your traffic is entering Tor. Furthermore, with advanced AI traffic detection, adding Mullvad makes the task of correlation significantly harder for a global adversary.\n5. Renting a Ghost Vps # The next step is to rent a VPS. I recommend using a privacy-respecting company like Njalla or 1984 Hosting. Ensure you use a different Monero wallet for this than the one used for your VPN to prevent any financial cross-contamination.\nWhy use a VPS at all? Why not go straight to the web after the Tor network? There are two main reasons:\nReputation: Tor exit nodes have a bad reputation, which causes many websites to block you or put you on a watch list.\nMetadata: Without a VPS, it is impossible to get rid of TCP/UDP packet metadata. If you use a standard VPN + Tor setup, the original packets from your local machine still reach the final destination. With a VPS, the packets are generated on the server. Since the VPS and your PC have different kernel metadata, you successfully decouple your hardware from your traffic.\n6. Using the Tor Network # To safely connect your PC to the VPS, we will use the Tor network after the VPN. Instead of connecting to the VPS\u0026rsquo;s public IP address (which would let the VPS company see your VPN\u0026rsquo;s IP), we will set up an Onion Service on the VPS.\nYou will generate Tor keys on the VPS and configure a hidden service for SSH or remote access. This allows you to connect to your server using a .onion address. By doing this, the connection stays entirely within the Tor network. Even the VPS provider won\u0026rsquo;t know where the connection is coming from—to them, the server is just talking to itself via the Tor daemon.\n7. Schizo Security: Remote Browser Control # As I mentioned, we aren\u0026rsquo;t just using the VPS as a simple proxy or Wireguard server. We will launch a browser inside the VPS and remote control the entire desktop. For this, we can use Kasm Workspaces.\nKasm uses a web-based protocol that is much better at handling the congestion and latency of the Tor network. Instead of sending raw network packets from your computer to a website, you are just receiving a stream of pixels. You can finally access the web with your second identity. Not even the NSA on steroids could trace this back to you, because even if they are spying on the VPS traffic, they only see the VPS interacting with the web—never your physical location.\n8. Limitations # The main drawback is that it is extremely complex to set up for a beginner. Additionally, because we are layering a VPN, the Tor network, and a remote desktop protocol (which usually runs over TCP), the experience will be slow. The \u0026ldquo;input lag\u0026rdquo; can be painful, making this a setup for high-stakes privacy rather than daily entertainment.\n","date":"24 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/anonymousvps/","section":"Posts","summary":"How to setup a ghost vps with no links to you","title":"Anonymous Identity","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"24 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"24 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/crypto/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Crypto","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"24 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"24 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/vps/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Vps","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/aboutme/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Aboutme","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"10 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/arch/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Arch","type":"tags"},{"content":" 1. The Installation Process is Manual # Unlike Ubuntu or Fedora, which have polished graphical installers that get you up and running in 15 minutes, Arch traditionally requires you to install the system via the command line. You must manually partition drives, mount filesystems, and edit config files. While an installer script (archinstall) now exists, the system is still designed to be built by hand, which is intimidating for many.\n2. High Maintenance Overhead # Arch is a rolling release distribution. This means updates are released constantly—sometimes daily. You cannot simply \u0026ldquo;set it and forget it.\u0026rdquo; If you don\u0026rsquo;t update for a few months, you risk breaking your system when you finally do because of major library changes or keyring issues. You are expected to be the system administrator at all times.\n3. \u0026ldquo;Bleeding Edge\u0026rdquo; Can Mean \u0026ldquo;Broken\u0026rdquo; # Arch packages are very new. While this means you get the latest features immediately, it also means you are often the first to encounter bugs. Regressions (updates that break previously working features) are more common in Arch than in stable point-release distributions like Debian or Linux Mint.\n4. You Have to Configure Everything # Arch adheres to the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, which in this context means the system comes with defaults only. It does not come with a desktop environment, audio server, printer drivers, or even a web browser pre-installed. You have to choose, install, and configure every single component yourself. This leads to decision fatigue and requires time.\n5. The \u0026ldquo;RTFM\u0026rdquo; Community Culture # The Arch community is incredibly knowledgeable, but it can be abrasive to newcomers. The prevalent attitude is \u0026ldquo;Read The F***ing Manual\u0026rdquo; (RTFM). If you ask a question on the forums that is covered in the documentation, you may receive a curt response telling you to read the Wiki rather than getting a direct answer.\n6. Stability is Not Guaranteed for Servers # Because of its rapid update cycle, Arch is rarely used in enterprise server environments. In those settings, stability and predictability (knowing software versions won\u0026rsquo;t change for years) are paramount. Arch prioritizes newness over long-term unchanging stability.\n7. The Risks of the AUR (Arch User Repository) # One of Arch\u0026rsquo;s biggest draws is the AUR, a community-driven repository of packages. However, these packages are user-submitted and unmoderated. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to read and vet a PKGBUILD file (the script that builds the package), you run the risk of installing broken or, in rare cases, malicious software.\n8. No Corporate Backing # Distributions like Fedora (Red Hat), Ubuntu (Canonical), and openSUSE (SUSE) have massive corporate backing. This ensures professional quality assurance, legal accountability, and long-term support. Arch is a community project; if the maintainers decide to drop support for something or change direction, there is no corporate entity to complain to.\n9. Documentation Dependency # To run Arch successfully, you generally need to keep the Arch Wiki open. While it is widely considered the best documentation in the Linux world, having to read technical manuals just to get your Bluetooth headphones working or to set up a printer is not a user experience everyone enjoys.\n10. It Is a Time Sink # Ultimately, Arch is a hobbyist OS. If your goal is to sit down at your computer and immediately start working, coding, or gaming without thinking about the OS, Arch gets in the way. You will spend hours \u0026ldquo;tinkering\u0026rdquo; to get things perfect—time that could be spent actually using the computer.\n","date":"10 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/whyarchsucks/","section":"Posts","summary":"10 unique reasons","title":"Why Arch Sucks","type":"posts"},{"content":" Leonardo Neves # Percurso Académico # Engenharia Informática e Computadores # Instituto Superior Técnico | Set. 2023 - Presente\nConcorri para este curso como 1ª opção, movido pelo forte interesse na área da computação.

If it\u0026rsquo;s not in the config, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. This post documents my journey of moving this website from a standard Ubuntu stack to a fully reproducible NixOS VPS.\nThe entire configuration can be found in my github Deployment ✈ # Provisioning the VPS # To deploy the configuration to my remote VPS, I use nixos-rebuild with a remote target. This allows me to keep my configuration files locally, version-controlled in Git, and push changes securely over SSH.\nThe command I use to deploy changes is:\nnixos-rebuild switch --flake .#my-vps --target-host my-user@vps-ip --use-remote-sudo In case you are doing the initial installation, ensure your SSH keys are correctly added to the configuration.nix file, or you will be locked out immediately after the first reboot! Rollback Strategy # One of the \u0026ldquo;superpowers\u0026rdquo; of NixOS is the ability to undo a broken deployment instantly. If a website update fails or a service doesn\u0026rsquo;t start, I simply run:\nnixos-rebuild switch --rollback NixOS creates a new generation for every change, making rollbacks atomic and instant. How to use ❔ # Because the system is declarative, adding a new service (like a database or a reverse proxy) doesn\u0026rsquo;t require manual installation via apt or yum. You simply add the module to your configuration.nix.\nEdit your configuration file locally. Define the service (e.g., services.nginx.enable = true;). Run the rebuild command targeting the remote host. Warning: Manually editing files in /etc/ is a thing of the past. Any changes made outside of the Nix configuration will be wiped on the next rebuild. Development 🛠 # The following sections break down how I structured the Nix expression for this website.\nThe Web Server Module # I use Nginx combined with ACME (Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt) for automated SSL certificates. Here is the snippet from my webserver.nix module:\nservices.nginx = { enable = true; virtualHosts.\u0026#34;mysite.com\u0026#34; = { forceSSL = true; enableACME = true; root = \u0026#34;/var/www/my-website/public\u0026#34;; }; }; security.acme = { acceptTerms = true; defaults.email = \u0026#34;admin@mysite.com\u0026#34;; }; Nginx is enabled as a systemd service. The virtualHost block handles the domain configuration. forceSSL automatically redirects HTTP to HTTPS. enableACME handles certificate generation and renewal automatically. Flakes Integration # To ensure reproducibility across my local machine and the VPS, I opted for Nix Flakes. This locks the versions of Nixpkgs so that the environment is identical regardless of when or where it is built.\nHere is a simplified flake.nix:\n{ description = \u0026#34;My Website Infrastructure Flake\u0026#34;; inputs = { nixpkgs.url = \u0026#34;github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-24.11\u0026#34;; }; outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: { nixosConfigurations.my-vps = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem { system = \u0026#34;x86_64-linux\u0026#34;; modules = [ ./configuration.nix ]; }; }; } Inputs define the exact commit of nixpkgs to use. Outputs define the resulting system configuration. This ensures that nixos-rebuild always uses the exact same package versions. Automated Backups # Finally, I\u0026rsquo;ve integrated Restic for encrypted, off-site backups, configured entirely through Nix.\nThe backup runs every night at 3 AM. It targets specific folders defined in the config. It automatically prunes old snapshots to save space.
